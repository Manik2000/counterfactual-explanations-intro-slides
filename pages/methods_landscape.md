The literature presents a diverse set of approaches for generating counterfactual explanations:

- **Gradient-based optimization**: iteratively modify features using model gradients
- **Genetic algorithms**: evolve populations of candidates toward valid counterfactuals
- **Growing spheres**: expand search regions from the original instance
- **Nearest neighbors**: find similar instances from the training data
- **Decision trees**: traverse interpretable tree structures to find alternative paths
- **Model-agnostic search**: treat the model as a black box and sample the input space
- **Generative models**: VAEs, GANs to generate realistic counterfactuals
- **Constraint satisfaction**: formulate as mathematical programming problems

Each approach offers different trade-offs between computational efficiency, interpretability, and the quality of generated explanations.
